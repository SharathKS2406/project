          <p>
            A global biodiversity hotspot and one of the most irreplaceable
            areas for conservation, western ghats region has a staggering plant
            and animal diversity overlapping with a dense human population. The
            hill ranges of the Western Ghats extend along the west coast of
            India from the river Tapti in the north to the southern tip of
            India. <br /><br />
            Their positioning makes the Western Ghats biologically rich and
            biogeographically unique - 'a veritable treasure house of
            biodiversity'. Though covering an area of 180,000km2, or just under
            6 per cent of the land area of India, the Western Ghats contain more
            than 30 per cent of all plant, fish, herpeto-fauna, bird, and mammal
            species found in India. Many species are endemic, such as the
            Nilgiri tahr and the lion-tailed macaque. In fact, 50 per cent of
            India's amphibians and 67 per cent of fish species are endemic to
            this region. Western ghats traverse the states of Gujarat,
            Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. But major parts
            lie in Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            The major river systems originating in the Western Ghats are the
            Godavari, Kaveri, Krishna, Thamiraparani and Tungabhadra rivers.
            These rivers have been dammed for hydroelectric and irrigation
            purposes with major reservoirs spread across the states. The Western
            Ghats account for 80% of India's hydropower generation. There are
            about 50 major dams along the length of the Western Ghats.
            <br />
            The Western Ghats are home to thousands of animal species including
            at least 325 globally threatened species. The Western Ghats face a
            lot of issues. Poaching, deforestation, forest fires, extra hunting
            and dangers to native tribes are the main threats.

          In this biodiversity hotspot, understanding plant and animal ecology,
          human impacts on wildlife species, and how people use and relate to
          natural resources is all critical and these motivate our research and

        <p>
          The animal life of the Western Ghats rainforests is rich and unique,
          with hundreds of vertebrate and thousands of invertebrate species,
          including a large fraction found only in the region. Even when
          continuous forests are reduced to fragments, they act as refuges and
          animal corridors and need to be conserved. Research has shown that
          fragments continue to play an important role as refuges for many
          species, besides acting as animal corridors. Even small fragments have
          conservation value, as persistence of many species is related to
          availability of suitable habitat or resources, rather than just the
          size of remnant. This suggests the need to also target fragments for
          protection and ecological restoration in order to expand conservation
          into wider landscapes.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Many animals of the Western Ghats, such as the endemic primates
          lion-tailed macaque and Nilgiri langur, are mainly found in the
          tropical rainforest habitat. Besides occurring in continuous forests
          within protected areas, many species in the Western Ghats have
          significant populations in rainforest fragments outside protected
          areas, such as within tea and coffee plantations.

          It seeks to understand communities that live within or in close
          proximity to tropical rainforests in the sanctuary, with the following
          areas of concern: (1) the nature, patterns, and variability of
          resource-use and extraction from within the rainforests, (2) the
          levels of community dependence on and linkages maintained with forests
          and markets, (3) demographic change and its repercussions on
          development objectives of human settlements and management of the

          cultural change.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Forestry and plantation-related developments over the years has caused
          the loss of tropical rainforests and lands that were used by tribal
          communities. These once self-sustaining communities have become
          dependent on outside resources inducing changes in lifestyles. Key
          areas of development that people envisioned were better education,
          access to employment, involvement in development schemes such as
          housing, food security, and water supply.

        <h4>THE SECRET LIFE OF LEOPARDS</h4>

          Leopards are amongst the most elusive of large mammals, and yet, one
          of the key conflict-prone species in India. This study, across a
          27,000 sq km landscape in Karnataka strives to understand leopard
          distribution across a habitat modification gradient, and their
          interactions with people in human-dominated landscapes. Leopards are
          known for their remarkable adaptability and it is no surprise,
          therefore, that their range is not limited to protected areas. Yet, in
          Karnataka, there is little reliable information on leopard
          distribution, especially outside protected areas and other natural
          habitats.In addition to the distribution of leopards, also estimating
          leopard densities within and outside protected areas through camera
          trapping surveys. Some preliminary data has revealed healthy leopard
          populations outside protected areas.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Leopards tend to be solitary animals and rarely interact with each
          other, except to mate or raise cubs. Leopards are territorial and male
          leopards will fight if their territories overlap. They mark their
          territory with urine and claw marks on the bark of trees. The research
          titled ‘Estimating population sizes of leopard cats in the Western
          Ghats using camera surveys’ provides the country’s first large-scale
          population estimates for the species. Researchers Arjun Srivathsa,
          Ravishankar Parameshwaran, Sushma Sharma and Dr. Ullas Karanth
          analysed camera-trap data from over 2075 sq km area covering Bhadra,
          BiligiriRangaswamy Temple (BRT), Bandipur and Nagarahole Tiger
          Reserves in Karnataka.Utilizing advanced spatial capture-recapture
          tecnhiques, the study found that Bhadra had the highest population
          density with over 10 leopard cats per 100 sq km area, followed by BRT
          with over four individuals per 100 sq km.

      <div class="bill">
        <p>
          Hornbills have captured the imagination, and the hearts, of
          populations across their habitats globally. Their large down-curved
          beak, size, eyelashes, unique calls, and the strong family bond they
          share make them an interesting study. They are often considered the
          indicator of good ecological health, and play a significant role in
          maintaining the balance in the environment they inhabit. The hornbills
          are omnivorous. They depend on a wide variety of fruits found in their
          habitat and vary their dietary habitat in different seasons based on
          food availability and diversity.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Hornbills are threatened worldwide by hunting and habitat loss. These
          birds require vast areas of primary forest to thrive, but due to human
          intervention, the forest cover has declined drastically over the past
          decades. One of the largest threats to Great hornbills in India is
          concerning hunting for casque and feathers in the decoration of
          traditional headgear of many tribes. Elsewhere they are also hunted
          for bushmeat and supposed medicinal value of their fat. Hornbills are
          identified as keystone species and also an indicator of ecosystem
          health. A fall in the hornbill population will reduce the dispersal of
          tree seeds, which will in the long run reduce the forest cover of the
          area. Awareness programs need to be conducted regularly for students,
          local community and in these areas and bring them into the frontline
          to protect hornbills and thereby securing the future for them and
          their next generations. In addition to nesting trees, conservation of
          existing fruits is also important in maintaining a good population of
          hornbills.

          <p>
            One of the reasons for habitat degradation along the edges of these
            forests is the demand for firewood by the rural communities who
            inhabit the region. Additionally, the usage of firewood is harmful
            too since biomass smoke has been found to contain toxic gases.
            Harvesting firewood requires the women to venture into the forests
            several times a week, often walking for hours on uneven terrain in
            harsh weather conditions with heavy loads.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            With an aim to reduce the pressure of firewood extraction in forest
            habitats, conservationists are encouraging forest-dwelling
            communities in the Cauvery and Malai Mahadeshwara Hills Wildlife
            Sanctuaries in Karnataka to switch to Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG).
            The Government of India initiative, the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala
            Yojana was launched in 2016 wherein families living below the
            poverty line were provided with LPG connections at subsidised rates
            and payment in monthly installments on purchases of cooking stove
            and the first refill. Harvesting firewood requires the women to
            venture into the forests several times a week, often walking for
            hours on uneven terrain in harsh weather conditions with heavy
            loads.

            Their livelihood and economy in this biodiverse, has been
            traditionally based on long fallows shifting cultivation of millets,
            pulses, and vegetables in fields spread over the hills, collection
            of local non-timber forest produce (NTFP) and hunting. In recent
            decades, deforestation and landscape change from the construction of
            dams, intensified agriculture, timber plantations and mining for
            bauxite and other minerals has negatively impacted communities. It
            has resulted in non-availability or decrease in availability of
            forest produce. These landscape changes forced people to abandon
            traditional forest-based livelihoods opportunities and migrate to
            MGNREGS or employment in seasonal labour work.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Consequently, many villagers shifted to irrigated cultivation to
            work as farm labourers or seasonal migrant workers in towns during
            summers. Primary occupations now are largely farming and manual farm
            / non-farm labour, work in the MGNREGS and in plantations and work
            in tourist boats. Baseline surveys show that the people here,
            especially the women, either opportunistically work for daily wages
            in larger agricultural fields, or more commonly collect dwarf date
            palm fronds from the forests to make brooms to sell. The women have
            received training on hand-stitching, machine sewing, embroidery and
            screen printing so far, successfully hand-crafting products like
            different kinds of bags and masks that are market viable and
            bringing in revenue from different fronts. This activity provides a
            sustainable solution by saving resources for wildlife and helping
            people with alternative incomes. The women are currently
            hand-crafting different bags like tote, drawstring, backpacks, and
            masks, all of which are for sale.

            Roads connect various types of human settlements but this is very
            disorienting for animals, as roads often become barriers to movement
            of animals across the landscape. Roads cutting through forests or
            other terrestrial landscapes are a major cause of animal mortality
            worldwide. Vehicular collisions with crossing animals are extremely
            commonplace on highways surrounded by natural landscapes or on
            smooth roads, where traffic drives at extremely high speeds. the
            primary cause of higher mammal deaths is the irresponsible behaviour
            of people passing through the area, who were often observed stopping
            by to feed troops of monkeys. Such easy access to food would
            naturally bring the monkeys closer to the roads more often.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            A few mitigation measures were identified and suggested to local
            authorities for better and wildlife friendly roads in this region.
            This included measures to enhance roadside aesthetics and value for
            wildlife, better roadside vegetation maintenance practices, and
            steps to minimise impacts on wildlife. Mitigation measures include
            placing speed breakers at specific identified locations, retaining
            roadside native vegetation and overhead tree canopy, leaving gaps in
            the sidewalls along the hill roads to permit smaller animals to
            safely cross the road,
